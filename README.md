just trying to make an online game of belote or coinche idk


aight stuff todo:

- when two players send an invite to each other need to just make them friends and remove the invite
Or just delete unessery invites when accept invites
- the whole system as of right now is not very idk how to say this: a person can be in 2 matches at the same time
doesn't make much sense


using precence instead of postgres changes may make way more sense as i can detect when user log out or something like that


idk now that i see it more it looks like shit
2 things {
    if i want to do it the right way => (def have to implement precence)
    if i just want this to get it over with just continue with what i have
}
